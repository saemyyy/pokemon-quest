# Pokémon Quest in Godot

## About the Project
**Pokémon Quest** is a fan-made Pokémon game developed with the Godot Game Engine. Players can explore two cities, challenge two gym leaders, and catch and train a variety of Pokémon. The name **Pokémon Quest** reflects the game's focused content, offering a smaller-scale experience than a full-fledged adventure, hence the term "quest."
